# ModernStack
This is my summer project I will be working on using C# Blazor, MongoDB, Kafka, RestAPIS
- Were using Blazor components that interact with MongoDB and Kafka, 
- Example: create blazor component with form to submit data to MongoDB and send Kafka message.

Set up the development environment:

Outline: 

Install the .NET Core SDK for C# development.
Install MongoDB: Visit the official MongoDB website (https://www.mongodb.com/) and download the MongoDB Community Server for your operating system.
Install Apache Kafka: Visit the Apache Kafka website (https://kafka.apache.org/) and download Kafka for your operating system.
Create a Blazor project:

Use the .NET CLI or Visual Studio to create a new Blazor project as mentioned in the previous responses.
Set up MongoDB integration:

Add the MongoDB driver to your C# project using NuGet packages. You can use the official MongoDB.Driver package.
Configure the connection settings to connect to your MongoDB server. This typically involves specifying the server address and authentication credentials.
Define data models and interact with MongoDB:

Define the data models that represent the structure of your data in MongoDB.
Use the MongoDB driver to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the MongoDB database.
Implement the necessary C# code in your Blazor project to interact with MongoDB, such as retrieving data, inserting new records, updating existing records, and deleting records.
Set up Kafka integration:

Add the Kafka client libraries to your C# project using NuGet packages. There are several available options, such as Confluent.Kafka or RdKafka.
Configure the connection settings to connect to your Kafka cluster or broker. This involves specifying the Kafka server addresses and other configuration parameters.
Implement Kafka producers and consumers:

Define the Kafka topics and message formats suitable for your project.
Implement Kafka producers in C# to send messages to Kafka topics.
Implement Kafka consumers in C# to consume and process messages from Kafka topics.
You can integrate Kafka producers and consumers within your Blazor project to enable communication with other systems or services through Kafka.
Develop the Blazor application:

Create the necessary components and pages in your Blazor project to build the user interface for your application.
Implement the business logic and user interactions using C#. This includes integrating with MongoDB for data storage and retrieval, as well as interacting with Kafka for message processing.
Test and deploy:

Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of your C# code.
Test the integration between your Blazor application, MongoDB, and Kafka components.
Deploy your Blazor application to a hosting environment or a server capable of running .NET Core applications.

# Rest Apis
Define the REST API endpoints:

Determine the functionality and operations you want to expose via your REST APIs. For example, you may have endpoints to create, read, update, or delete data from MongoDB, or endpoints to produce or consume messages from Kafka topics. Decide on the URL structure and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for each endpoint.

Create a new REST API project: 
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
Run the following command to create a new C# Web API project:

=
```
dotnet new webapi -o MyRestApi
```
This command creates a new C# Web API project named "MyRestApi" in a directory called "MyRestApi".


# Configure MongoDB and Kafka connections:
Install the required NuGet packages for MongoDB and Kafka integration in your REST API project.
Set up the MongoDB and Kafka connection configurations in your project. This could include specifying the MongoDB server address, authentication details, Kafka server addresses, and other related settings.

# Implement the REST API endpoints:
In your REST API project, create controllers or classes to handle the different REST API endpoints.
Implement the necessary HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for each endpoint, including the logic to interact with MongoDB or Kafka as required.
Use the MongoDB driver and Kafka client libraries to perform the desired operations within each endpoint.

# Test the REST APIs: Run your REST API project and test the endpoints using tools like Postman or curl. Send HTTP requests to the defined endpoints and verify the responses and functionality.

# Integrate the REST APIs with your Blazor project: 
In your Blazor project, make HTTP requests to the REST API endpoints using the HttpClient class or a dedicated library like RestSharp.
Update your Blazor components or pages to handle the responses and data received from the REST APIs.
Use the returned data to populate UI elements, trigger actions, or update the application state.
