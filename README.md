# ModernStack
This is my summer project I will be working on using C# Blazor, MongoDB, Kafka.

Set up the development environment:

Outline: 

Install the .NET Core SDK for C# development.
Install MongoDB: Visit the official MongoDB website (https://www.mongodb.com/) and download the MongoDB Community Server for your operating system.
Install Apache Kafka: Visit the Apache Kafka website (https://kafka.apache.org/) and download Kafka for your operating system.
Create a Blazor project:

Use the .NET CLI or Visual Studio to create a new Blazor project as mentioned in the previous responses.
Set up MongoDB integration:

Add the MongoDB driver to your C# project using NuGet packages. You can use the official MongoDB.Driver package.
Configure the connection settings to connect to your MongoDB server. This typically involves specifying the server address and authentication credentials.
Define data models and interact with MongoDB:

Define the data models that represent the structure of your data in MongoDB.
Use the MongoDB driver to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the MongoDB database.
Implement the necessary C# code in your Blazor project to interact with MongoDB, such as retrieving data, inserting new records, updating existing records, and deleting records.
Set up Kafka integration:

Add the Kafka client libraries to your C# project using NuGet packages. There are several available options, such as Confluent.Kafka or RdKafka.
Configure the connection settings to connect to your Kafka cluster or broker. This involves specifying the Kafka server addresses and other configuration parameters.
Implement Kafka producers and consumers:

Define the Kafka topics and message formats suitable for your project.
Implement Kafka producers in C# to send messages to Kafka topics.
Implement Kafka consumers in C# to consume and process messages from Kafka topics.
You can integrate Kafka producers and consumers within your Blazor project to enable communication with other systems or services through Kafka.
Develop the Blazor application:

Create the necessary components and pages in your Blazor project to build the user interface for your application.
Implement the business logic and user interactions using C#. This includes integrating with MongoDB for data storage and retrieval, as well as interacting with Kafka for message processing.
Test and deploy:

Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of your C# code.
Test the integration between your Blazor application, MongoDB, and Kafka components.
Deploy your Blazor application to a hosting environment or a server capable of running .NET Core applications.
